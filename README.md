## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web UI framework
- **Groq API**: AI model (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: PDF text extraction
- **SQLite**: Knowledge Memory Module for data persistence
- **JSON**: Data serialization for plans and structured content

## 🔧 Configuration

### Groq API Model
The application uses `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model by default. You can modify this in `utils/groq_client.py`:

```python
self.model = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
```

### Database Location
The SQLite database is created as `vectortutor.db` in the project root. You can change this in `utils/memory.py`:

```python
def __init__(self, db_path: str = "vectortutor.db"):
```

## 📝 Notes

- **PDF Size**: Very large PDFs may be truncated during processing. The system processes the first ~15,000 characters for structuring.
- **API Limits**: Be mindful of Groq API rate limits and usage quotas.
- **Data Persistence**: All data is stored locally in SQLite. The database persists between sessions.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "GROQ_API_KEY not found"
- Make sure you've created a `.env` file with your API key
- Verify the key is correct and has no extra spaces

### "Error extracting PDF text"
- Ensure the PDF is not password-protected
- Check that PyMuPDF is properly installed
- Try with a different PDF file

### Import errors
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify you're using Python 3.9 or higher
